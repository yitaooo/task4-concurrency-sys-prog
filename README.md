# Concurrent Programming

This week you will implement a simple locking construct by relying only on primitive atomic operations. You will also implement a scalable, thread-safe concurrent data-structure. This will be achieved by following two different paths:
1. using locks
2. using a lock-free algorithm.

## Deliverables

1. Implement the spinlock that is declared in `cspinlock.h` to generate a library called `libcspinlock.so`. 
2. Implement a lock-based hashmap datastructure that is declared in `chashmap.h` to generate a library called `liblockhashmap.so`.
3. Implement a lock-free hashmap datastructure that is declared in `chashmap.h` to generate a library called `liblockfreehashmap.so`. 

**NB:** For tasks 1 and 3, only atomic primitives (e.g., compare-and-swap, atomic fetch-and-increment, etc.) are allowed. No synchronization library can be used (on Rust you can use `std::sync::atomic`).

### Tip for Rust

You allocate datastructures via
[Box](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) and cast those
to/from raw pointer when implementing the alloc/free functions required by the
`chashmap` and `cspinlock` interface.

## Test Setup
There are three tests that needs to be passed to complete this task successfully.

### Mutual exclusion
`test_mutual_exclusion.py` expects `libcspinlock.so` and checks whether the implementation of `cspinlock` guarantees that no two critical sections can execute concurrently.

### Lock-based Hashmap
`test_lockhashmap.py` expects `liblockhashmap.so` and checks for the following:
1. the concurrent hashmap is implemented correctly
2. the hashmap scales with increasing number of threads

### Lock-free Hashmap
`test_lockfreehashmap.py` expects `liblockfreehashmap.so` and checks for the following:
1. the concurrent hashmap is implemented correctly
2. the hashmap scales with increasing number of threads in high contention workloads.

## Hints

- Both lock-based and lock-free hashmap tests rely on the `hashmap-driver.c` to execute a workload on the hashmap. You can check the usage of this code to test your own.
- The hashmap does not need to check if an element is already in the hashmap before inserting
- Inserts should be relatively fast (i.e. insert at the beginning of the bucket, not the end)

## Going further
1. If you want to further develop your concurrent programming skills you can check other synchronization techniques such as Read-Copy-Update (RCU) and figure out how can the hashmap use RCU.  
1. Another direction that is important for lock-free programming is memory reclamation. You can try to understand how to safely reclaim deleted nodes from the hashmap.
